## Markers and practice sections tools  
Here you'll find the Markers to Sections tool, i'm looking to add a Delete Sections tool too.  
  
### Markers to sections  
This tool is self-explainable. It copys Reaper markers and adds them into the EVENTS track as Text Events with the proper **[prc_(section)]** format.
